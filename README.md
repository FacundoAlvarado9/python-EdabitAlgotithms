### These are solutions to some of the Edabit.com's Python excercises

If you don't know, Edabit.com is a website in which you can practice algrotihm-creation by solving challenges.

These solutions are not necesarily the "correct ones", but they're what I came up with.
Obviously, the same result can be achieved in different, more efficient and, probably, better ways.

If you have other solutions, or soultions to other problems, don't hesitate to collaborate
Enjoy!

#### Long live to Python!
